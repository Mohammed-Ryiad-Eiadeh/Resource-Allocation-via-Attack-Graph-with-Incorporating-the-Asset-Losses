# Paper Tiltle: AARA-PR: Asset-Aware PageRank-based Security Resource Allocation Method for Attack Graphs

# abstract

Interdependent systems face rising cybersecurity risks. This paper introduces a security decision-making framework managed by a single defender. We use cyber attack graphs to model vulnerabilities and prioritize critical assets using the PageRank algorithm. Our approach demonstrates resilience to concurrent attacks and outperforms existing algorithms in resource allocation across four real-world scenarios, supported by statistical tests. The full implementation is available for further research exploration
